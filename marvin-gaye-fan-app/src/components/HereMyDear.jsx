                <p>Marvin Gaye was going through a personal crisis in the summer of 1976. In November 1975, Gaye's estranged first wife, Anna Gordy Gaye, sued Gaye for divorce, claiming irreconcilable differences, and sought child support for their adopted son, Marvin Gaye III.  After months of delays, in March 1977, the singer's attorney, Curtis Shaw, wanted to end divorce proceedings and convinced Marvin to give up half of the percentage of album royalties he would earn from his next Motown album to Anna. The Gayes' divorce was finalized in June.</p>
                <p>At 73 minutes long, it dwarfs his previous masterpieces and it seems only fitting that it does. Just as the marriage was a slow, sustained dive to oblivion, so the album simmers just below boiling point, content to release the anger and frustrations of married life in sporadic bursts across the extended running time. Indeed, one of those moments is as perfect a moment as you will find anywhere in soul music. </p>
