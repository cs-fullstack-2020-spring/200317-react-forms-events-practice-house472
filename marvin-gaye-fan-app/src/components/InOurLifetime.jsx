            <p>His most underrated album in a way is a true classic. While not quite as good as his other 4 classics, this album showcases Marvin flirting with a slightly newer sound while implementing soul and funk we came to love from him to the highest power in his music. It was his last album on Motown and he went out with a bang. After hitting a personal low, Marvin would produce and arrange this entire album and out of it came greatness like "Funk Me", "Life Is For Learning", "Ego Tripping Out", and my favorite "Heavy Love Affair". In Our Lifetime is a true gem in the Motown catalog period, and it is honestly one of the greatest pieces of work that Marvin created.</p>
