# 20-03-17 React Forms + Events Practice
### Practice Makes Perfect - I have provided some vague directions to create a stateful react app covering the main concepts from 20-03-13 through 20-03-17. Use the directions provided to set up a unique app of your own! Once your app is complete and functional write a brief description of what your app does in the section at the bottom of this file. This practice assignment can double as your personal project for the week as well!

### Directions
- Create a new react app (be sure to use a meaningful name that starts with a lowercase letter)
- Create a folder called `components` - this is where you'll put all your class based components
- Create a class based component called `AppContainer` with an h1 tag with the text `[YOUR APP TITLE]` - this will be the parent component for the components you create a little further down this list
- Render the `AppContainer` component in the browser - this just means reference it in the default parent component (`hint` it's a function based component)
- Create a `child form component` with a meaningful name - this component will render a form with at least 5 fields of your choosing 
- When the form is submitted in your `child form component` save the data and pass it to the parent component and clear the form fields
- Create a `child display component` with a meaningful name - this component will render all items from the form submissions array that is passed down from the parent component
- Style the app! Have fun with it! (I would suggest getting a little grid practice)
- Add any complexity that you want!
